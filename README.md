============================

### Tasks

- Present data in table view
- Send User Id from table view to detailed view
- Present user details
- Send email using default email application
- Display Images 
- Format images
- Debug 

### Footnote

Start from first task, mote to next one when you sure it's working ap to this point. It's better to see some results than nothing
 
Results are more important than playing by the book. Make sure we can see result and if you have enough time refactor and optimise your code
 
Some tasks maybe not as simple as it seams. We assuming you already know basics, but that being said try simple approach first as some tasks as as simple as it seams :)
